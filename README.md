# CoralPredationLirman2023
Code for the analysis of the Restoration Trial Team data as part of a Masters of Professional Science degree requirement

#Version Information:
All code was written to be compatible with R version 2.2.2 (Released October, 2022) and supported packages.

#About the write-up
Link to University of Miami repository will be provided when available, as well as any potential future journal publication. Manuscript can be provided by request.

#About the data
Data included 2 year surveys of coral outplants monitoring condition, predation pressure, and presence of corallivores
Data may be provided in this repository at a later date or at approved request. I do not have permission to approve such requests myself, but may create a dummy dataset to be used as an example in a future commit.

#Instructions for running the code
Stat with running "Mini_Report," specifying the directory and CSV for the data set at line 25.
Individual data cleaning steps starting at the header on line 28 may vary slightly based on research goals and dataset.
There are currently commented instructions for introducing environmental objects from the other stand-alone codes.
I will be consolidating everything into a single code in a future commit, but wanted to go ahead and make the functional code available.
